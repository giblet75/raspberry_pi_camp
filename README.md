# raspberry_pi_camp
Code for Raspberry Pi Camp 2015

This is a collection of python scripts that will form the basis of the sensor lab for our Summer 2015 Raspberry Pi camp.
Not really exciting, just trying to get something together that will show the kids what is possible with a Raspberry Pi, a Pibrella and a little bit of Python.
